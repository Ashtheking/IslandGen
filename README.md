IslandGen
---------------

IslandGen was my sophmore year project for APCS. It was never fully finished, buI have plans for the code, as it has uses in other projects I plan to work on.

IslandGen is a program that generates an Island (duh) based on parameters specified in the code (ATM), and displays it in different views based on the "mods" in mods.config. Many of them are not finished.
